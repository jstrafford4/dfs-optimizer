# Not much to see here

My main, and in a sense only, achievement in this fork off of dfs-optimizer, was linear.py, just proving to myself I could find a python library to quickly run my knapsack problem for DFS.  I got it to work in theory, and that was where I set off to make my own projections.

Reading the existing code also helped me learn python, and give me ideas for the future.  I won't bother cleaning the code up, I really just want to hold onto it for future nostalgia.
